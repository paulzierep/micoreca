# Microbiome Community Resource Catalogue (MiCoReCa)

The rapid growth of microbiome research has led to the development of numerous bioinformatics tools and databases, but information about them remains fragmented across disparate, often outdated cataloging efforts, hindering resource discovery and utilization.

To address this critical gap, the [ELIXIR Microbiome Community](https://elixir-europe.org/communities/microbiome) collaborates with the [Research Software Ecosystem](https://research-software-ecosystem.github.io/) to create MiCoReCa (Microbiome Community Resource Catalogue), a comprehensive, dynamic, open-access catalogue of microbiome-related bioinformatics resources:
- Tools from [Research Software Ecosystem Atlas](https://research-software-ecosystem.github.io/RSEc-Atlas/)
- Workflows from [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/)
- Training
- Standards
- Databases

# Prepare environment

- Install virtualenv (if not already there)

    ```
    $ python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv
    ```

- Create virtual environment

    ```
    $ python3 -m venv env
    ```

- Activate virtual environment

    ```
    $ source env/bin/activate
    ```

- Install requirements

    ```
    $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
